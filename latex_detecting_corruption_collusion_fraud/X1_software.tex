\noindent The software in used in this project is free software. All the code was written using the  language \texttt{R Project for Statistical Computing}\begin{quote}``R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.'' \footnote{See \cite{R:Bloomfield:2014} for an R user guide.} \cite{r_pagina},\end{quote}
and \textit{Python}
\begin{quote}``Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.''\cite{python_about}.\end{quote}

\texttt{Python} is general-purpose programming language and \texttt{R} is  a programming environment optimized for statistics. They're all widely used in the business and academic worlds, and the modules help users working with those languages to connect to the World Bank Development Indicators API and access the latest data.

To summarize and visualize the data, all the graphs were made with \texttt{ggplot2} \parencite{wickham_ggplot} a package for \texttt{R} writen by Hadley Wickham. To create the global map using the spatial data, the project uses \texttt{Quantum-Gis (QGIS)}\footnote{See \cite{clifford1981} for details of what's spatial data.} \footnote{GIS refers to Geographical Information Systems and it refers to the set of techniques that uses spatial data, see \cite{GIS05}  for more details.}. To make the searches at Google using many Amazon Web Service's computers it uses \texttt{Parallel} \parencite{Tange2011a} to distribute the tasks. For the development, edition an writing, this project uses \LaTeX - A document preparation system \cite{latex}.

\texttt{Python} \texttt{pandas} is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
